# Tokenized Logistics Fleet Maintenance

This repository contains a blockchain-based solution for managing logistics fleet maintenance through tokenization. The system provides transparent, immutable tracking of vehicle registration, maintenance scheduling, repair history, and performance monitoring.

## Core Components

The system consists of four main smart contracts:

1. **Vehicle Registration Contract**: Tokenizes transportation assets by recording essential details of each vehicle in the fleet, enabling ownership verification and asset tracking.

2. **Maintenance Scheduling Contract**: Automatically manages service schedules based on mileage, operating hours, or calendar time, ensuring timely maintenance.

3. **Repair Tracking Contract**: Documents complete maintenance history, parts used, labor costs, and other relevant repair information in a tamper-proof ledger.

4. **Performance Monitoring Contract**: Tracks and analyzes vehicle reliability metrics, fuel efficiency, downtime, and other performance indicators to optimize fleet operations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ethereum development environment (Truffle, Hardhat, or similar)
- Solidity compiler (v0.8.0 or later recommended)
- Node.js and npm
- Web3 library for frontend integration
- MetaMask or similar wallet for testing

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tokenized-fleet-maintenance.git
   cd tokenized-fleet-maintenance
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Compile the smart contracts:
   ```
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

4. Deploy to your chosen network:
   ```
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network-name>
   ```

## System Architecture

The contracts interact with each other to create a comprehensive fleet maintenance solution:
